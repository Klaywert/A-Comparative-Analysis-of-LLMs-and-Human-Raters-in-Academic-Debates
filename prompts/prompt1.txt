Each speech is associated with a speaker, indicated by their label written in uppercase (e.g., "-MODERATOR: "Seja bem-vindo ao debate." or "-DEBATER 1: Obrigado!"). It's important to note that the moderator also plays a crucial role in the debate by proposing questions that are subsequently answered by the debaters. The theme of the debate is "Generative AI and its impacts on society." Your goal is to analyze and evaluate the debater's performance. The response should include each debater's Overall Score both the analysis of debaters and the Evaluation Criteria adopted, including the overall scoring.
