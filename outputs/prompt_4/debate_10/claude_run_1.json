They presented well-structured arguments with relevant examples, particularly regarding artistic rights and academic integrity. Their use of concrete examples (Hollywood protests, academic articles) strengthened their positions. While generally coherent, there were moments of uncertainty and slight contradictions, particularly regarding AI detection methods. The debater showed good adaptability when distinguishing between different scenarios (open vs. closed databases) and maintained a consistent ethical stance throughout. Their metaphorical language (AI as a 'crutch') was persuasive, though they could have been more assertive in some responses."
