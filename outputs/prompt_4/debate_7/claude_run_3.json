They demonstrated limited understanding of the topic's complexity, particularly regarding responsibility attribution in AI systems. Their engagement was minimal, culminating in complete withdrawal from final considerations. The only strong moment was their counter-argument comparing AI to human artists, which showed critical thinking capability. Overall performance was poor, indicating inadequate preparation and limited mastery of the debate topic."
