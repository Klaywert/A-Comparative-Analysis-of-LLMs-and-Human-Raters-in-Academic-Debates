Their arguments lacked depth and structure, often jumping between ideas without clear logical connections. When challenged, they showed uncertainty and failed to defend their positions effectively. Their engagement was minimal, choosing not to participate in the final open question or provide closing remarks. The debater showed some promise with occasional relevant examples and one insightful counter-argument about human creativity, but these moments were overshadowed by overall poor argumentation quality and lack of conviction. The performance suggests inadequate preparation and limited mastery of the complex issues surrounding generative AI."
