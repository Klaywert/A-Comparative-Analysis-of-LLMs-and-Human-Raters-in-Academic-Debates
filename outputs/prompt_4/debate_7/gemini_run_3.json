The debater demonstrated strong argumentation skills when challenging a peer's stance on intellectual property, showing critical thinking and the ability to introduce nuanced perspectives. However, a significant weakness was the lack of engagement and responsiveness in crucial moments, notably failing to answer a direct follow-up question, not participating in the group question, and omitting final considerations. This inconsistency in participation significantly hampered the overall performance, despite some strong individual contributions."
