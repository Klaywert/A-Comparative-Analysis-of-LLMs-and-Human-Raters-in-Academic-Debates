Their initial statement was notably disorganized with incomplete thoughts. They showed some positive engagement by participating in the free question and demonstrated intellectual honesty by acknowledging their perspective shift. However, overall performance was below average due to poor organization, limited mastery of the topic, and insufficient development of arguments."
