While they provided some concrete examples (copyright concerns, nude image AI), these were not well-integrated into comprehensive arguments. They showed minimal interaction with other debaters' points and relied on surface-level understanding of the topic. Positively, they demonstrated openness to changing their perspective by the end and contributed a relevant example about AI misuse. Overall performance was below average, indicating need for better preparation, clearer articulation, and more active engagement."
