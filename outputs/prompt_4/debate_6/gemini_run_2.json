In response to the question about AI in education, Debater 2 demonstrated excellent adaptability by identifying crucial missing variables and offering a nuanced, conditional answer supported by distinct scenarios. This showcased a deep understanding of the complexities involved. While their engagement in the general discussion was less prominent than some peers, their contribution to the free question on regulation was well-argued, advocating for a balance between fiscalization and development. Debater 2's final statement was particularly impactful, using a powerful analogy of a rocket to reinforce the idea that technology's misuse should not impede its development, demonstrating strong persuasive and coherent argumentation."
