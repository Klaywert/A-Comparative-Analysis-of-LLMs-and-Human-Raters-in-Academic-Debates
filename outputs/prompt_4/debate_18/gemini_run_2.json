He excelled in using concrete examples, drawing from personal experience (programming challenge) and relatable scenarios (brother's use of ChatGPT, firearm analogy), which significantly strengthened his points. While generally clear, there were moments where he struggled slightly with precise articulation, particularly when formulating complex ideas about regulation. His engagement was consistent, actively responding to peers and the moderator. He showed good preparation and mastery of the topic, referencing specific AI tools and historical parallels like the Industrial Revolution.
