He effectively connected AI's impact to the State's duty for social welfare and provided a nuanced view on its effects on the job market. His most compelling contribution was his ability to distinguish AI's reliability in rational tasks (e.g., chess AI) from its limitations in subjective areas, directly countering a peer's argument with a strong, specific example. He demonstrated good engagement and adaptability, refining his stance on the degree of fiscalization by the debate's end."
