Their arguments were often supported by relevant historical and contemporary examples, showcasing a deep mastery of the topic. They were highly adaptable, effectively responding to and nuancing points made by other debaters, and maintained a coherent stance throughout. The debater's ability to distinguish between different aspects of AI's impact (e.g., responsibility for harmful content vs. IP) and to provide logical counter-arguments was particularly noteworthy. While not overtly persuasive in rhetorical style, the strength of their argumentation and clarity of thought were highly effective."
