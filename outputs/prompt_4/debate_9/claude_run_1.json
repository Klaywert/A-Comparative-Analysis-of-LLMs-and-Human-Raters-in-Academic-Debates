Their use of analogies and historical examples was particularly effective in illustrating complex points. They showed good engagement with other debaters and adapted well to counterarguments. However, they sometimes lacked concrete data to support claims and occasionally contradicted themselves on the feasibility of AI control. Their arguments were generally well-structured and persuasive, though sometimes verbose. Overall, a solid performance with room for improvement in providing specific evidence and maintaining complete consistency in positions."
