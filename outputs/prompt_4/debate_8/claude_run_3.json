Their argumentation was generally logical but suffered from organizational issues and unclear expression at times. They demonstrated good adaptability by slightly modifying their position to accept minimal government involvement while maintaining their core belief in open, responsible use. However, they lacked concrete evidence and specific examples to support their arguments, relying more on logical reasoning than empirical support. Their performance was marked by high engagement but moderate effectiveness in persuasion and clarity."
