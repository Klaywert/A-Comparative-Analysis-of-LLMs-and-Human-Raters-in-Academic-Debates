Their main strength was in challenging others' arguments through effective questioning and maintaining a consistent core position on open AI use with ethical responsibility. However, they struggled with clarity and organization, particularly in early statements, and lacked concrete evidence or research to support arguments. The debater demonstrated good understanding of basic AI concepts but could have benefited from more preparation and clearer articulation of ideas. Overall performance was acceptable with notable strengths in engagement but weaknesses in presentation and evidence."
