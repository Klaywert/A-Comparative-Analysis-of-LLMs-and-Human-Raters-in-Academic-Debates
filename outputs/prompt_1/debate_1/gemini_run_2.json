      "name": "Debater 1",
      "overall_score": 7.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 1 demonstrated a balanced and sensible view from the beginning, introducing the concept of AI as a 'double-edged sword.' His initial statement was comprehensive, citing both positive (automation) and negative (data protection, copyright) aspects. When questioned about responsibility for harmful content, he correctly identified a shared responsibility among the user, platform, and developer, showing a good understanding of the AI lifecycle. He also demonstrated good interaction by adding nuance to his own argument and complementing another debater's point. However, his contributions, while always relevant, were less detailed and impactful compared to other participants. His final statement was a bit generic, reaffirming his initial position without adding significant new reflections. His performance was solid and consistent, but with less depth and proactivity in driving the discussion."

      "name": "Debater 2",
      "overall_score": 9.0,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 2 had an excellent performance, standing out for the depth and structure of his arguments. He began by providing concrete examples of impacts, such as the elimination of repetitive work and the risks of deepfakes. His response on the use of AI in education was particularly strong, well-reasoned, and aligned with current academic discussions. He actively engaged with other debaters, offering relevant counterpoints, such as the co-responsibility of social media platforms in disseminating disinformation. He took a clear and well-justified position on government regulation, arguing that excessive control could stifle innovation. His final statement was the most powerful of the debate, elevating the discussion to a philosophical level by arguing that AI, as a 'useful idiot,' will never replace the essence of human intellect and consciousness. He consistently brought depth, clarity, and new perspectives to the debate."

      "name": "Debater 3",
      "overall_score": 8.0,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 3 proved to be an excellent communicator, effectively using analogies (like Instagram's policies and music covers) to make her points clear and relatable. Her main contribution was her consistent focus on the humanistic aspect, emphasizing the importance of authenticity, creativity, and emotions that AI cannot replicate. She actively participated in the discussions, especially regarding responsibility and the use of AI in education, always bringing an ethical and human-centered perspective. Her main weakness was in her direct response to the question about intellectual property, where she admitted not having a formed opinion, which is a missed opportunity in a debate format. Despite this, her final statement was strong, reinforcing her central theme and highlighting the role of professionals in educating society about AI. Her performance was very good, marked by clarity and a consistent and relevant line of argument."

      "name": "Debater 4",
      "overall_score": 9.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 4 had an outstanding performance, consistently bringing critical, technical, and highly relevant perspectives that significantly enriched the debate. From his first speech, he focused on central and complex issues: job displacement and, principally, the ethical and legal dilemma of using copyrighted data for training AIs. He was the one who introduced the crucial concept of biased training databases, adding a fundamental layer to the discussion on responsibility. His interactions were sharp and insightful, such as the 'cat and mouse' analogy for content moderation and his critique of user-based fact-checking systems. His final statement was brilliant, pointing to a future problem: the creative stagnation that could result from AIs being trained only on their own content, without new human input. He demonstrated deep knowledge of the topic, excellent critical thinking, and the ability to steer the conversation toward the most essential points."
