    {
      "name": "Debater 1",
      "overall_score": 7.0,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 1 provided a balanced initial perspective, correctly identifying AI as a 'double-edged sword'. His response to the question of responsibility for harmful content was well-reasoned, implicating developers, platforms, and users. He also showed nuance by later clarifying his point based on the type of platform. However, his participation in the broader discussion was less prominent compared to others, and his final statement was weak, acknowledging that his opinion might have changed but failing to articulate a new or reinforced position. His performance was solid but lacked the depth and consistent engagement of the other participants."
    },
    {
      "name": "Debater 2",
      "overall_score": 9.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 2 demonstrated an outstanding performance, characterized by deep, nuanced, and well-structured arguments. His initial statement was highly insightful, distinguishing between repetitive and intellectual labor and identifying key societal risks like deepfakes. His answer regarding AI in education was exemplary, promoting its use as a tool for enhancement rather than a shortcut. He engaged constructively with other debaters, gracefully acknowledging counterpoints. His final statement was particularly strong, offering a philosophical perspective on the limits of AI in replicating human consciousness ('um idiota útil, muito rápido') and connecting the topic to broader ethical frameworks. He was consistently the most articulate and thoughtful contributor."

    {
      "name": "Debater 3",
      "overall_score": 8.0,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 3 excelled at bringing a humanistic and ethical perspective to the debate. Her initial and final statements were compelling, focusing on the risk of AI diminishing human authenticity and creativity, using effective examples like the emotionless voices on TikTok. She consistently contributed valuable, practical ideas to the general discussion, such as her recurring analogy of platform guidelines (like Instagram's) to manage AI use. Her main weakness was her direct response to the question on intellectual property, where she admitted to not having a formed opinion and struggled to formulate a clear stance. Despite this, her overall contribution was significant and provided a crucial counterbalance to the more technical discussions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Debater 4",
      "overall_score": 9.0,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 4 was the most technically grounded and pragmatic participant, consistently elevating the debate with specific, insightful points. His opening statement immediately zeroed in on the critical issues of job displacement and copyright over training data. Throughout the debate, he introduced crucial concepts, such as inherent bias in training datasets, the importance of prompt engineering in education, and the 'cat and mouse' nature of combating misinformation bots. His arguments were focused, relevant, and demonstrated a strong understanding of the underlying mechanics of generative AI. His final statement effectively summarized his core concern about the ethics of using copyrighted data, showcasing consistency in his viewpoint."
