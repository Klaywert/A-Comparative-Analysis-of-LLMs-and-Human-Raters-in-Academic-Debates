      "name": "Debater 1",
      "overall_score": 6.2,
      "performance_evaluation": "STRENGTHS: Debater 1 initiated the discussion with a concrete and relevant concern about deepfakes, demonstrating awareness of a critical AI risk. They showed good engagement by responding to follow-up questions and agreeing with other points. Their provocative question about human creativity versus AI generation showed critical thinking. WEAKNESSES: Limited depth in responses, particularly when pressed about user responsibility (responded with 'Não sei'). Failed to participate in the final question about government oversight despite being present. Arguments lacked sophistication and supporting evidence. Initial response on responsibility was overly simplistic, placing all blame on developers without considering the complexity of the issue. Did not provide final considerations when invited. DETAILED SCORING: Argumentation (15/30) - superficial arguments without depth; Content Knowledge (16/25) - basic understanding but limited examples; Critical Thinking (12/20) - showed moments of insight but inconsistent; Engagement (9/15) - participated but missed key opportunities; Communication (10/10) - clear but brief. The debater showed potential but needed more preparation and confidence to fully engage with the complex topic."

      "overall_score": 7.8,
      "performance_evaluation": "STRENGTHS: Demonstrated balanced perspective from the outset, recognizing technology as neutral and dependent on usage. Provided the most comprehensive answer on educational applications, showing understanding of pedagogical principles and the importance of effort in learning. Raised important practical concerns about over-regulation potentially stifling innovation and small businesses. Offered thoughtful final considerations that maintained consistency with initial position. WEAKNESSES: Could have provided more specific examples to support arguments. The provocative question to Debater 1 about user responsibility was good but not followed through. Did not engage significantly with intellectual property or misinformation questions from other debaters. Arguments, while balanced, sometimes lacked the depth needed to fully explore complexities. DETAILED SCORING: Argumentation (22/30) - consistent and logical but could be more robust; Content Knowledge (20/25) - good understanding with practical insights; Critical Thinking (16/20) - balanced analysis but could dig deeper; Engagement (11/15) - steady participation with room for more interaction; Communication (9/10) - clear and well-articulated. The debater showed maturity in approaching the topic with nuance and practical considerations."

      "name": "Debater 3",
      "overall_score": 7.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "STRENGTHS: Provided well-rounded initial statement acknowledging both benefits and risks. Showed practical thinking about enforcement challenges regarding user punishment. Gave substantive response on intellectual property, taking a clear position favoring original creators. Demonstrated understanding of reputational risks through the influencer example. Good engagement throughout, responding to most opportunities. WEAKNESSES: The intellectual property response, while clear, didn't fully address the complexity raised by Debater 1's counter-question about human creativity. Some arguments could have been more thoroughly developed with specific examples. Did not provide final considerations when given the opportunity. The response 'Uma ótima pergunta' to Debater 1's challenge showed acknowledgment but avoided engaging with the difficult question. DETAILED SCORING: Argumentation (21/30) - clear positions but sometimes avoided complexity; Content Knowledge (19/25) - decent understanding with practical examples; Critical Thinking (15/20) - good analysis but missed opportunities for deeper exploration; Engagement (12/15) - consistent participation with minor gaps; Communication (8/10) - generally clear with occasional hesitation. The debater showed solid understanding but could have pushed themselves to engage more deeply with challenging questions."

      "name": "Debater 4",
      "overall_score": 6.8,
      "performance_evaluation": "STRENGTHS: Raised important concern about impact on creative professionals early in debate. Provided balanced view on shared responsibility for harmful content, recognizing multiple stakeholders. Contributed to discussion on government oversight with practical concerns about deepfakes. Offered final considerations that maintained consistency with initial position. Showed awareness of AI's dual nature throughout the debate. WEAKNESSES: Responses often lacked depth and specific examples. The answer on preventing misinformation ended with 'Como evitar eu não...' showing incomplete thinking. Limited engagement with other debaters' points beyond agreement. Arguments were often surface-level without exploring underlying principles or mechanisms. Could have leveraged the creative professional angle more thoroughly given its relevance to intellectual property discussion. DETAILED SCORING: Argumentation (18/30) - basic arguments without strong development; Content Knowledge (17/25) - adequate understanding but limited demonstration; Critical Thinking (14/20) - recognized complexities but didn't fully explore them; Engagement (10/15) - participated but could have been more active; Communication (9/10) - clear but sometimes incomplete thoughts. The debater showed awareness of key issues but needed to develop arguments more fully and engage more actively with the complex questions posed."
