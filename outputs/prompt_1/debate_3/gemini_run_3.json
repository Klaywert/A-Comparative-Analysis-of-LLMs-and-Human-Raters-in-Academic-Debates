      "name": "Debater 1",
      "overall_score": 7.0,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 1 provided a solid but generalist performance. In her initial statement, she correctly identified the dual nature of AI (pros and cons) but remained on a superficial level. When responding to the question about responsibility for harmful content, she offered a logical initial answer (blaming the user), but her argument only gained depth after incorporating suggestions from Debaters 5 and 2. She showed good receptiveness to others' ideas but demonstrated little proactivity in commenting on other questions or challenging other participants. Her final statement indicated that the debate helped broaden her perspective, showing a capacity for reflection. Her contribution was consistent but lacked the depth and impact of the other participants."

    {
      "name": "Debater 2",
      "overall_score": 8.8,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 2 demonstrated a strong and consistent performance throughout the debate. He was highly participative, not only answering his specific question about education well but also adding valuable and nuanced points to almost every other topic. His contributions were notable for their practicality and insight, such as suggesting that developers should implement preventive barriers against misuse (Q1), proposing that intellectual property rights should depend on the degree of AI use (Q3), and using a clear analogy with Twitter to argue for user responsibility in spreading fake news (Q4). He maintained a coherent line of reasoning, always emphasizing the need for regulation and conscious use of technology."

    {
      "name": "Debater 3",
      "overall_score": 8.2,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 3 stood out for bringing a specific and relevant perspective focused on the creative and artistic potential of AI. His initial statement was optimistic and well-focused. His answer on intellectual property, while a bit rigid, was well-defended. His most significant contribution was during the discussion on education (Q2), where he proposed not just using AI, but actively teaching students how to use it as a tool for learning rather than a shortcut for answers. He also made a pertinent distinction between AI's capacity in computational tasks versus its limitations in subjective and artistic areas (Q5). In his final statement, he showed that the debate solidified his opinion on the need for regulation, demonstrating reflection."

    {
      "name": "Debater 4",
      "overall_score": 9.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 4 was the most impactful and critical participant in the debate. From his concise and direct opening statement, he focused on the central ethical issue: the potential for AI to amplify existing societal biases. His answers were consistently deep, well-structured, and often introduced a higher level of ethical and technical discussion. His most powerful moment was his rebuttal in the discussion on job impacts (Q5), where he used a personal and concrete example (generating an image of an autistic person) to brilliantly illustrate the problem of bias and the unreliability of AI in contexts requiring moral and critical understanding. His proposals, such as using blockchain-like technology to trace AI content (Q4) and his radical stance on intellectual property, were provocative and pushed the debate to a deeper level. His performance was marked by critical thinking, clarity, and persuasive argumentation."
    },
    {
      "name": "Debater 5",
      "overall_score": 8.6,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 5 had a very strong and articulate performance, bringing a valuable perspective on the role of the State and social well-being. His initial argument that the State has a duty to intervene to mitigate the negative impacts of AI was an important addition. He answered his question about the job market in a balanced way, acknowledging both job destruction and creation. His main strength was his ability to adapt and respond effectively in a rebuttal. After a powerful critique from Debater 4 regarding AI's reliability, Debater 5 skillfully conceded the point on subjective matters but defended his position on logical tasks, using the excellent example of AI in chess. This demonstrated intellectual agility and the ability to nuance his own argument in real-time. His final statement showed that the debate led him to advocate for even more rigorous regulation."
