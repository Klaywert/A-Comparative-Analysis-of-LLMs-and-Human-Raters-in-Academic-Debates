      "name": "Debater 1",
      "overall_score": 7.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 1 provided a balanced and sensible initial perspective, highlighting the 'thin line' between the pros and cons of AI. She answered her specific question about responsibility clearly, attributing it primarily to the user, but also to the developer in cases of malicious intent. She demonstrated good adaptability by agreeing with and incorporating a point made by Debater 5. Her final consideration showed that she was engaged in the debate, mentioning that her perspective became more optimistic about the benefits of AI. While her contributions were coherent and relevant, they lacked the depth and specific examples brought by other participants, keeping her performance solid but not outstanding."

      "name": "Debater 2",
      "overall_score": 9.0,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 2 demonstrated a strong and consistent performance. He effectively used analogies (WWII technology, Twitter) to make his points more relatable and powerful. His contributions were consistently nuanced and practical, such as his suggestion that developers should proactively build safeguards against misuse and his case-by-case approach to intellectual property based on the user's level of contribution. He directly answered his question about AI in education with a practical focus on the risks and responsibilities. His active participation in other questions consistently added value and a pragmatic perspective to the discussion."

    {
      "name": "Debater 3",
      "overall_score": 8.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 3 stood out for his focus on the creative and educational applications of AI. His initial statement was optimistic and well-defined. His most significant contribution was during the discussion on education, where he introduced the crucial idea that students must be taught *how* to use AI as a learning tool, rather than just as an answer machine. He defended his position on intellectual property well, arguing that credit should primarily go to the data creators and the platform. He also provided a valuable clarification in the discussion about jobs, distinguishing between AI's strength in computational tasks and its weakness in tasks requiring emotional intelligence and critical thinking."

    {
      "name": "Debater 4",
      "overall_score": 9.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 4 was the most incisive and critical participant, consistently elevating the debate with an ethical and regulatory focus. His most impactful moment was his powerful counter-argument on the reliability of AI, using the specific and personal example of generating a biased image of an autistic person. This effectively demonstrated the real-world problem of AI reinforcing societal prejudices. His proposals were concrete, such as using technology to mark AI-generated content and assigning shared responsibility for misinformation. His 'radical' but well-argued stance on intellectual property (that it should never belong to the user) introduced a unique and thought-provoking perspective. His final summary was sophisticated and perfectly encapsulated the complexities of the issue."
    },
    {
      "name": "Debater 5",
      "overall_score": 8.8,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 5 demonstrated excellent debating skills and intellectual flexibility. He effectively framed the issue within a broader context, mentioning the State's duty to ensure social well-being. When challenged by Debater 4's strong argument against AI's reliability, he masterfully adapted his position. He conceded that AI is unreliable in subjective matters but reinforced his argument for its reliability in rational tasks, using the perfect example of chess engines. This showed a great ability to listen, adapt, and strengthen an argument under pressure. His final statement, acknowledging that the debate convinced him of the need for more rigorous regulation, highlighted his reflective and engaged participation."
