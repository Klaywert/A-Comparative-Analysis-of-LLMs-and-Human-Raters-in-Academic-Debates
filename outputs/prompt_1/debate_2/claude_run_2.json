      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 1 demonstrated solid performance with consistent engagement throughout the debate. STRENGTHS: Showed balanced perspective acknowledging both positive and negative aspects of AI; provided specific examples (ChatGPT in education, impact on artistic professions); demonstrated evolution in thinking about responsibility attribution; maintained coherent argumentation throughout. WEAKNESSES: Limited depth in exploring complexities; some self-contradiction when discussing developer responsibility (acknowledged by the debater); minimal engagement with other debaters' points; could have provided more concrete examples or evidence. The debater effectively addressed the responsibility question with nuanced thinking, recognizing the unpredictability of AI outputs. Final statement appropriately synthesized the discussion's complexity.

      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 2 showed adequate participation but with limited depth and engagement. STRENGTHS: Emphasized the importance of conscious and rational use of AI tools; clearly articulated position on educational use of AI; recognized the need for human touch in artistic fields; consistent messaging about moderation and responsibility. WEAKNESSES: Minimal participation in cross-debate discussions (no comments on others' responses); relatively superficial treatment of complex issues; didn't fully explore implications of positions taken; limited original insights beyond common observations. The response to the education question was competent but lacked innovative perspectives. Failed to engage when others were invited to comment, missing opportunities to demonstrate critical engagement.
