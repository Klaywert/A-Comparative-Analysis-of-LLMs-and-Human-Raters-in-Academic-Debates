      "name": "Debater 1",
      "overall_score": 7.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 1 demonstrated solid understanding of generative AI's dual nature as both beneficial and potentially harmful. Their initial statement effectively framed the debate by acknowledging AI's power in accelerating research and production while warning about devaluation of creative workers. In response to the accountability question, they provided a thoughtful perspective on responsibility lying with those who train AI systems, showing understanding of how AI learns from human behavior. They contributed meaningfully to discussions about AI hallucinations and supported balanced regulation that doesn't stifle innovation. Their final statement showed intellectual growth and openness to new perspectives. However, their participation was somewhat limited compared to others, with fewer spontaneous interventions and less engagement with peers' arguments. While their contributions were valuable, they could have been more proactive in challenging ideas or introducing new dimensions to the discussion."

      "name": "Debater 2",
      "overall_score": 8.5,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 2 emerged as one of the most engaged and critical participants in the debate. They immediately expanded on initial concerns by introducing the deepfake threat and consent issues, demonstrating strong awareness of AI's darker applications. Their response to the education question was particularly nuanced, highlighting the lack of source attribution in AI-generated content and the authenticity problem. They actively engaged with others' responses, asking probing follow-up questions about platform liability and copyright. Their personal anecdote about ChatGPT providing false information about a family member effectively illustrated AI hallucination problems. They consistently advocated for stronger oversight and user accountability measures, referencing existing social media fact-checking systems as models. Their Black Mirror reference in closing statements showed cultural awareness and ability to connect fiction with real concerns. Their performance was marked by high engagement, critical thinking, and consistent contribution throughout all debate phases."

      "name": "Debater 3",
      "overall_score": 7.0,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 3 showed good understanding of AI applications, particularly in medicine and rapid analysis capabilities. Their initial statement appropriately raised concerns about image authenticity and attribution challenges. When addressing intellectual property questions, they provided a reasonable framework distinguishing between original AI creations and those based on existing works, suggesting watermarking as a solution. However, their position on government oversight was somewhat contradictory and underdeveloped - advocating against government regulation while supporting user accountability through IP tracking, without fully addressing implementation challenges raised by others. Their participation in spontaneous discussions was limited, missing opportunities to defend or elaborate their positions when challenged. Their final statement showed reflection and acknowledgment of debate complexities, but overall engagement and depth of analysis were less robust compared to more active participants."

      "name": "Debater 4",
      "overall_score": 8.0,
      "performance_evaluation": "Debater 4 demonstrated strong critical thinking and emotional engagement with the ethical dimensions of AI. Their initial agreement with others was quickly supplemented with emphasis on human intent as the core problem. They showed excellent engagement by actively commenting on others' responses, particularly regarding educational implications where they highlighted the superficial learning problem. Their passionate stance against AI-generated content creators claiming authorship showed strong ethical reasoning. When answering about misinformation, they provided practical solutions drawing parallels with existing platform features like WhatsApp's forwarding indicators. They consistently participated in discussions, raising important points about the increasing difficulty of detecting AI-generated content. Their acknowledgment of the complexity of assigning responsibility and the risk of over-censorship showed nuanced thinking. Their final reflection on how these issues often go unnoticed demonstrated metacognitive awareness. While highly engaged and thoughtful, they could have introduced more original frameworks or solutions beyond existing platform features."
