      "performance_evaluation": "STRENGTHS: Demonstrated balanced perspective acknowledging both benefits and risks of AI. Made relevant historical parallel about technological innovation creating new jobs while eliminating others. Showed practical understanding of responsibility issues. WEAKNESSES: Arguments lacked depth and sophistication - mostly surface-level observations. Failed to elaborate on initial points about academic misuse. Limited engagement with complex ethical questions. Response on responsibility was somewhat simplistic, not fully considering systemic issues. Did not build upon others' arguments effectively. DETAILED SCORING: Argumentation (1.8/3) - basic but coherent; Content Knowledge (1.3/2) - adequate but superficial; Critical Thinking (1.2/2) - showed some balance but lacked depth; Responsiveness (1.2/1.5) - answered questions but minimally engaged with others; Originality (0.6/1) - historical parallel was somewhat insightful; Communication (0.4/0.5) - clear but basic expression."

      "performance_evaluation": "STRENGTHS: Recognized AI's potential for automation and efficiency. Identified the reliability problem with AI-generated information. Suggested practical solutions like content filters and limits. WEAKNESSES: Extremely brief responses lacking substantive analysis. Failed to develop arguments beyond initial statements. Did not engage meaningfully with complex questions about intellectual property or misinformation. Minimal participation in discussions. Arguments were generic and lacked specific examples or deeper insights. DETAILED SCORING: Argumentation (1.5/3) - very basic, underdeveloped points; Content Knowledge (1.1/2) - showed basic understanding but no depth; Critical Thinking (1.0/2) - minimal analysis, mostly stating obvious points; Responsiveness (1.0/1.5) - answered when required but didn't engage with others; Originality (0.5/1) - no unique perspectives offered; Communication (0.7/0.5) - brief and somewhat unclear at times."
