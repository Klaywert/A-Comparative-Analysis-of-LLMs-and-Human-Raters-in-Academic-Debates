      "performance_evaluation": "STRENGTHS: Demonstrated balanced perspective acknowledging both benefits and risks of AI. Made relevant historical parallel about technological innovation creating new jobs while eliminating others. Showed practical understanding of responsibility issues. WEAKNESSES: Arguments lacked depth and sophistication - mostly surface-level observations. Failed to elaborate on initial points about academic misuse. Limited engagement with complex ethical dimensions. Response on responsibility was somewhat simplistic, placing blame primarily on users without considering systemic issues. Did not build upon others' arguments effectively. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE: Initial statement was brief and underdeveloped. Response to responsibility question showed basic understanding but lacked nuance. Job market contribution was the strongest point, showing historical awareness. Final statement merely reiterated initial position without evolution. Overall, demonstrated adequate but unremarkable performance with room for substantial improvement in analytical depth."
