She effectively articulated the dual nature of AI technology and showed good adaptability when agreeing with valid points from others. Her arguments were generally well-structured, though she could have provided more specific examples and data.

Her warning about potential government bias in oversight showed critical thinking, though this point needed more development. Overall, a competent performance with room for improvement in engagement and depth of argumentation."
