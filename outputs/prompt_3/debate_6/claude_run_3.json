Their participation was notably passive compared to other debaters, with minimal engagement in group discussions. The opening statement lacked structure and specific examples, though they improved toward the end with more coherent arguments about regulation balance. Overall performance was below average due to limited engagement and evasive responses."

Their direct challenge to Debater 1 sparked productive discussion. However, their arguments lacked depth and technical understanding, relying more on intuition than evidence. The willingness to change position after hearing counterarguments demonstrated admirable adaptability, though it also suggested initial positions weren't thoroughly considered. Overall, a solid performance marked by active participation and openness to other viewpoints."
