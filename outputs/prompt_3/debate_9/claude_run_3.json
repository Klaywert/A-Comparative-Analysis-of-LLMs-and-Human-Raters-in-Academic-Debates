Their arguments were well-structured, supported by relevant historical and contemporary examples, and maintained logical consistency throughout. They showed excellent engagement skills, actively participating in discussions and effectively countering opposing viewpoints. Their optimistic yet cautious stance was well-articulated, acknowledging both benefits and risks while maintaining that proper regulation can ensure positive outcomes. The debater's ability to draw parallels between current AI challenges and historical technological disruptions added depth to their arguments. Their only minor weakness was a slight contradiction regarding the controllability of AI development, but this did not significantly detract from their overall excellent performance."
