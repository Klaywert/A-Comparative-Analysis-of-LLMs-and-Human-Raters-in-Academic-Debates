While he presented a clear initial stance and directly answered his assigned question, his arguments often lacked depth and failed to consider the multifaceted nature of the issues. His reliance on a single, somewhat generic example (students) in his opening statement, and the simplistic argument for sole user responsibility, indicated a superficial engagement with the topic's complexities. A significant weakness was his passive engagement throughout the debate, failing to contribute to any open discussion rounds or the free question. His final consideration, a simple 'Não,' further underscored a lack of preparedness or willingness to reflect on the debate, severely impacting his overall score for engagement and coherence."
