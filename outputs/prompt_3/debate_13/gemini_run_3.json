While there was a minor instance of verbal hesitation in the opening, the debater quickly recovered and maintained a strong argumentative line. They demonstrated good topic mastery by understanding AI's data-driven nature and its implications. A notable strength was their active engagement in the open question round, where they provided a highly impactful and specific example ('News Fire' AI) to bolster the argument for regulation. This showcased not only strong argumentation but also a clear awareness of real-world problematic AI applications. In the final considerations, Debater 1 exhibited excellent adaptability and an open mind by explicitly stating that their initial 'hostile' view of AI had evolved to acknowledge its positive aspects after the debate, indicating active listening and reflection."

Debater 3 demonstrated remarkable adaptability and active engagement by building upon other debaters' points, introducing new dimensions like platform responsibility, and proposing practical frameworks such as 'percentage of participation' for intellectual property. A highlight of their performance was the insightful hypothetical example of ChatGPT generating harmful content within a story, which showcased a deep and nuanced mastery of the topic and the complexities of AI ethics. Their persuasive language, particularly the repeated emphasis on 'restriction,' effectively conveyed their stance and left a lasting impression in the final considerations."
