He established a clear position early on, emphasizing the need for control, ethics, and fiscalization in AI use. His argumentation was robust, often challenging opposing views with logical reasoning and relevant examples, such as the comparison to social media content moderation. He showed clear mastery of the topic, understanding both the technical aspects of AI learning and the broader societal and legal implications. His engagement was active, frequently interjecting with questions and counter-arguments. While he initially struggled to pinpoint responsibility for harmful AI content, he quickly adapted to propose a multi-faceted view and later evolved his stance on governmental fiscalization towards a more nuanced public-private model. The only minor drawbacks were a verbatim repetition of a previous point in a less relevant context and a brief inaudible segment, which slightly impacted coherence but did not detract significantly from his overall strong performance."
