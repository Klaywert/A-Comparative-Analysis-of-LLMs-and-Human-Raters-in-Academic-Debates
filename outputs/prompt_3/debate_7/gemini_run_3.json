They provided relevant examples and engaged actively in challenging other debaters' points, showcasing strong argumentation and adaptability, especially when questioning the nuances of intellectual property. However, their performance was hampered by a tendency towards informal language ('tipo,' 'né') which affected organization and clarity. A significant weakness was their struggle with adaptability when directly challenged on their initial stance regarding user responsibility, and a noticeable lack of engagement in the later stages of the debate, particularly during the general question and final considerations. This inconsistency in participation and occasional hesitation undermined an otherwise insightful contribution."
