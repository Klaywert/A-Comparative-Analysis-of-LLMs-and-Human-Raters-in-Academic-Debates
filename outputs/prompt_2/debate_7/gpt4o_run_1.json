While they provided relevant examples, their arguments lacked depth and clarity at times. They engaged well with other debaters, particularly in the question and answer session, but showed some difficulty in adapting to counterarguments. Overall, their understanding of the topic was adequate, but could benefit from more structured argumentation and clearer communication."
