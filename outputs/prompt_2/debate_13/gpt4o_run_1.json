However, their initial speech lacked clarity and was somewhat disorganized, which made it difficult to follow their line of reasoning. They used relevant examples, such as the potential for AI to infringe on copyrights, but could have provided more concrete evidence to strengthen their arguments. Debater 1 engaged well with the moderator's questions and other debaters' points, showing a good level of adaptability and engagement. Their final remarks indicated a shift in perspective, showing openness to the positive aspects of AI, which reflects adaptability."

Their arguments were well-structured and coherent, making it easy for the audience to follow. Debater 2 showed strong engagement by responding to the moderator's questions and interacting with other debaters' points.
