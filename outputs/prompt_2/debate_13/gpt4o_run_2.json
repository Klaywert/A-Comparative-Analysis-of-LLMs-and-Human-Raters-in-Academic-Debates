        "performance_analysis": "Debater 1 presented a clear understanding of the potential threats posed by generative AI, particularly in terms of copyright infringement and job displacement. However, their arguments were sometimes unclear and lacked a structured flow, which affected the overall clarity. They used relevant examples, such as the potential for AI to infringe on copyrights, but could have provided more concrete evidence. Their engagement was strong, as they responded to questions and participated actively. They showed adaptability by considering other points of view during the debate. Overall, Debater 1 demonstrated a good level of preparation and understanding of the topic, but could improve in organizing their thoughts more clearly."
